Taking advantage of the creativity that accompanies mania has lead me to developing the variety of techniques that are seen in my work, from layering mixed media, combining painting and drawing, and finger painting.
Making art has allowed for a release of energy, provides an outlet for the turbulence that life brings, enables the exploration of the senses.
